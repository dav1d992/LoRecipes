# Lo Recipe App 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4.
The purpose of the this app was to get some further hands-on experience with Angular. 
It contains elements like: 
- Component communication 
- Services 
- Directives 
- Routing 
- Guards 
- Pipes 
- Forms
- Observables 
- Unit testing
- Firebase

The app is far from perfect, but that hasn't kept me from deploying it anyway. Have a look @[www.recipes.dav1d992.com](https://recipes.dav1d992.com/auth)

## Run locally
After pulling down the solution remember to install all packages. Using npm you can enter `npm i` in the CLI. 

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
